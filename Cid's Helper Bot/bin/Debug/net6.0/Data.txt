Teri; A bounty hunter assigned to keep track of Scarlett, what sort of secrets does this devil hold? https://imgur.com/msr78Te~ 
Eustus; A gruff hardworking individual who enjoys listening to stories and drinking, if your ever in the mood come on down to his tavern to drink your worries away! https://imgur.com/UoB5WQI~ 
Merlin; Merlin is a tea loving wizard who goes extra with the magic he performs.  If you want to learn how to do magic of any kind, or have a nice philosophical chat he's your guy.  Merlin is a world traveler so he has some stories to tell.  Most notably, he was the one to discover Cafe Leblanc and communicated with other world travelers of its safe space for a nice place to drink and discuss diplomatic affairs.  (Though he still tries to get Sojiro to serve Tea with his Curry). https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQdAo2khcc5e6KGwhnlUj8g_w3jO_woACeWew&usqp=CAU~ 
Johnson; Johnson, what was once another nameless NPC, has grown significantly strong due to his aptitude in time magic he learned from Merlin.  He is quite humble and often considers himself weaker than he actually is.  He is a master of the sphere and uses it for physical combat, giving him options for any type of foe.  While he doesn't have that deep of a story, he is a warrior for the light fighting for what is right.~ 
Tira; Tira is a master of mirrors and illusions.  Despite her forward personality and nature, her mirrors deflect the much deeper side of her.  After waking up in an unfamiliar world, lost of all her memories, Dess and Xehanort were fascinated by her as she is a nobody with some of the strongest powers any nobody has had.  Eventually going Psychotic from all the pressure and expectations Dess and Xehanort had for her.  She betrayed the original Z-Team in order to steal a keyblade and return to Dess and Xehanort.  After an emotionally charged battle with the Z-Team, she spent some time alone reflecting who she truly is.  What mysteries does she hold?  Who knows.~ 
Noctis; Noctis Lucis Caelum is the prince of Insomnia. He is a cocky impulsive dork but is kind hearted and loves his friends at the same time. Despite his edgy appearance he is not emo at all. A good friendo who tries his best but also can get overwhelmed by emotions easily. http://pm1.narvii.com/7467/496b064fe64be81e6d164e5f01aaefc88b64d91dr1-1200-675v2_uhq.jpg~ 
Mickey; What may be a cute little mouse is the King of all things Disney.  Even the Gods on Olympus have this guy's symbol everywhere.  Don't let his small and mouse appearance fool you though, Mickey is King for a Reason.  Mickey is a true master of the Keyblade as well as amazing when it comes to time, light, and reflect magic.  Even having the most powerful spell of Ultima under his belt.  Even with his power, he's the nicest fella you'll ever meet.  And when he's with his trusted knight Goofy and the strongest black mage around Donald, he is unstoppable.  If you do something to harm any of his friends, you're in for a Royal beatdown. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/2/29/Mickey_KHIII.png/revision/latest?cb=20180212235425~ 
Donald; Donald Duck, one of the most powerful Mages in the entirety of both Square Enix and Disney's libraries.  He is the King's royal magician, following the King's orders no matter what.  His vocal pattern... is not the easiest to understand, especially when it comes to his anger issues.  Whether or not he heals you is up to him. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/9/99/Donald04.png/revision/latest?cb=20190127214138~ 
Goofy; Despite his limited vocabulary and not the greatest at smart stuff, he can be one of the most brilliant members in the Kingdom Hearts universe.  Goofy's personality is well Goofy, and he is a father to his son Max.  Despite his thin stature and small shield, Goofy is not a tank to be messed with, being able to use his shield to block strikes from even the strongest foes, including Xehanort.  Despite his loyalty to the King, if doing what Mickey orders puts him against his friends, he'd be one to stand up for what's right.  Don't let his name and personality fool you, Goofy is the Royal Knight for a reason. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/7/73/Goofy_KH3.png/revision/latest?cb=20181214004524~ 
Mitama; Mitama is one of the various services available around RG, running a shop for Magical Girls. For the cost of Grief Seeds, you can get your soul gem adjusted for various different power ups and items. This is in fact her power, the ability to go into Soul Gems and adjust them. She very rarely fights for herself as she isn't very capable of it, but if it comes to it, she can use her own gloves as a weapon. While she resides in Radiant Garden, she stands as a neutral party, and a place for all Magical Girls to get powered up for the right price. Whenever you see her, she will have a sunny and friendly smile, always trying to offer advice and tips. How genuine this happiness is however, is up for debate. https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000345010818-vkajgc-t500x500.jpg~ 
Barret; Despite his looks, he is quite kind to those who need it.  He fights for the planet and those who are forced into terrible situations.  Once you get to know him, he is one of the kindest souls you'll find in Radiant Garden.  Even so much as giving inspirational speeches to his allies before any task, no matter how small.  But if you get on the bad side, well you may end up seeing that his arm and materia aren't just for show.  In this campaign, he seeks to understand what is causing worlds to fall to darkness and seeks to stop them. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/a/a8/Barret_Wallace_from_FFVII_Remake_promo_render.png/revision/latest?cb=20191126233717~ 
Sora; Sora is a master keyblade wielder of light who fights with the power of his friends.  (And by friends I mean 7+ copies of himself).  In this campaign he serves as his own entity unconnected to Roxas and Xion, and has his own unique style.  Bringing inspiration from both KH2's drive forms and KH3's keyblade transformations, Sora is by far the strongest warrior of the entire RG crew.  However, he... isn't the brightest.  Often falling for traps and can't piece anything together more complicated than "light good, dark bad"  There's a reason Goofy is the most intelligent character in the KH universe. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/0/00/Sora_KHIII_RM.png/revision/latest?cb=20191212180535~ 
Nemu; Nemu, one of the 3 leaders of the Wings of the Magius. As one of the Magius, it is her dream to see a world without witches and salvation for all magical girls. Nemu is a literary genius, and also the least outspoken one of the Magius 3. On the other hand however, she is by far the most logical of the 3, typically leading any strategy meetings on what their next move should be. It's not likely for her to be immediately aggressive towards opposition, but nothing will get between her and her dream. https://gamepress.gg/magiarecord/sites/magiarecord/files/2019-09/Hiiragi%20Nemu%20%28School%202%29.png~ 
Touka; “Well well well, you invade our world line to what? Take out one of your strongest allies? Brilliant move Z-Team. It sure did us a favor at least. Oh, I suppose it's time I finally introduce myself. You've already met Nemu, Alina, and a vast number of our wings, but I am easily the most powerful of them all. I am Touka Satomi, one of the 3 leaders of the Wings of the Magius. Not only that, but I am the smartest person in this world line. Why am I here you may ask? Well, I got a bit impatient. You people dare vote on inferior member of our team before me? Truly absurd. Therefore, I went ahead and hacked one of your members accounts to decide it for myself. You're welcome!” - Touka https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTE42wVoGCdQgQOF4_MdqRWkhROOdwHZdXDpw&usqp=CAU~ 
Alina; Alina is an artist with heavy focus on life and death in her art, but her breaking point was when a critic said her art has no direction, and acts like "a drug that could make people go mad." This led to her destroying all her art and jump from a building. Before she could jump however, Kyubey showed up. After kicking the creature, she made a contract, and immediately jumped. As a person, she is one of the most crazed people around, sometimes saying she wants an enemy's hair after killing them to incorporate into her art, or simply desiring to turn a world into her canvas. Upon seeing a Heartless for the first time, instead of being scared or afraid, she felt a euphoric sense of beauty. As a Magical Girl, beware of her paint. While her art might make people go mad, her paint definitely will cause madness just from the touch. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/madoka/images/c/cd/Alina.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200805135307~ 
Mifuyu; Mifuyu is someone all the other wings look up to. A veteran magical girl, Mifuyu is the highest ranked among the White Feathers, and is also the closest to the Magius. Not one to be an instigator, Mifuyu would rather talk problems out. This is because she specializes in Illusion magic, typically helping the Feathers escape from a losing battle. Don't underestimate her strength however, as her weapon can be used in all sorts of terrifying manners. If that's not enough, she can use her own illusions on herself to multiply her power, but only as a last resort. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/madoka/images/8/80/Mifuyu-1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200805152851~ 
Momoko; She's a team leader sort. If you're with her, she's very kind and caring about ya, always reliable. If you're against her however, she can be ruthless, especially if you're beating up on her younger students. She also has very notable bad timing, sometimes showing up at the worst of times.  https://gamepress.gg/magiarecord/sites/magiarecord/files/2019-06/momoko_valentines.png~ 
Konoha; If Hazuki is the outgoing Magical mom of the group, then Konoha is much more the introverted Magical mom. Her and Hazuki actually go way back and commonly work together, even watching over the same Black feathers together. She has a very cold exterior, but once you get to know her, she becomes very protective and could potentially even spoil the younger members. As for fighting, she wields a double-sided lance. While powerful in her own right, she gets even more powerful when she's fighting for/saving things that are important to her. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/c/c8/Shizumi_Konoha_04.png/revision/latest?cb=20171006133955~ 
Hazuki; One of the more outgoing members of the wings, she's someone who's always gathering information and in the know, always trying to get along with everyone. Her methods of information gathering are very open and persuasive, preferring to just ask questions instead of hiding in the shadows. In this regard, she's like the extrovertive mom of the Wings. As a magical girl, beware of her Twin Hook Swords and her special wish power: the ability to scan your body and immediately know your strengths and weaknesses are. So if things get tense during your chats with her, watch out, she'll know exactly where to strike. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/5/54/Yusa_Hazuki_03.png/revision/latest?cb=20171006133956~ 
Kanoko; Daughter of the owners of a sheet metal plant, Kanoko aspires to instead be a fashion designer. What kind of fashion you may ask? Why metal clothes of course! If this doesn't suit your fancy, she is planning another line of mushroom themed clothing. Her love of mushrooms goes beyond outfits in fact, she's always gathering them in her free time as well. Need to know anything about mushrooms? Kanoko is the one to ask. Despite the strange looks she might get and how silly she might seem, she is always serious and 100% dedicated to her cause. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/5/57/Yayoi_Kanoko_02.png/revision/latest?cb=20170823202437~ 
Rika; Rika and Ren are inseparable.  Ren has always been extremely shy, unable to form any sentences under any pressure, as a result when she was younger, her classmates would bully her as she couldn't speak up.  This eventually led to her jumping off a building before having a moment of panic calling for Kyubey to grant her wish and save her.  She uses a Staff which can turn into a Scythe and holds the power of Nirvana, or the ability to adjust emotion.  Despite her new powers and form, she was still trapped in her horrible life until she met Rika.  Rika is a gay disaster. She's very much into fashion, make-up, and all things girly girl. This is especially shown in her weapon, which is a compact mirror that shoots lasers. Despite all that, she is very much in love. Do anything to harm Ren, and you'll have a rampaging lesbian on your hands. Never underestimate her when it comes to standing up for her friends and her confidence in protecting them. https://gamepress.gg/magiarecord/sites/magiarecord/files/magical_girl_cards/card_30313_c.png~

Shizuku; The RG crew has Gummi Ships, and the Organization uses Dark Portals, so how do the Wings get around? Shizuku is your answer, with her ability to "join spaces." With mastery over portals, and wielding dual chakrams, she can truly come at her opponent from any angle. She's a Magical Girl who wanders about trying to find a place where she belongs. Unable to figure out what she likes, what she hopes to be, or even her own identity, she is always in a state of anxiety. Like the cafe her family runs, she is calm and quiet. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/f/ff/Hozumi_Shizuku_Winter_Clothes.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20210212120904~ 
Masara; An almost emotionless Magical Girl, Masara was born into a peaceful family and raised by two loving parents. Despite all the love she was given, she remains cold, living a life lacking excitement. Deep inside, though, she is thirsty for something more. https://gamepress.gg/magiarecord/sites/magiarecord/files/2019-06/masara_casual.png~ 
Ryo; One of the more light-hearted/serious members of the wings, Ryo takes photos of everything and reports it regardless if it’s good or bad. Because of this everyone is both afraid of her and entertained by her. Thanks to her wish, her photography is infallible, never missing the perfect shot. Just making sure she's taking your picture, and not aiming her bazooka at you. While her aim with that isn't as her camera, that doesn't mean you can underestimate her. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/4/4f/Midori_Ryou_04.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/280?cb=20181112120158~ 
Kanae; A lover of all things punk and rock, Kanae had a very rough life on the darker side of town. With a life full of thugs and gangs, she was eventually forced to make a wish in order to eradicate a gang who had kidnapped her friend. She fights with a lead pipe and isn't afraid to jump to aggression as the first answer to a problem. Watch out for her special wish power when she rushes you, the ability to completely ignore armor and any defense you may have set up. Aggression aside, she's very protective of the team that took her in. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magiarecord-en/images/a/a7/Yukino_Kanae_05.png/revision/latest?cb=20180521064234~ 
Xehanort; While not a nobody himself, he has a fascination with them.  Beings without souls that are able to persist through will power alone.  In his early years, he studied these creatures, most notably Dusks.  Through his strength and will, he has been able to command such creatures.  Eventually, Xehanort traveled to other worlds for more knowledge, finding strong warriors, keyblade wielders, and talented researchers alike.  Many of them retained their form despite being a nobody.  What started off as a few member group has grown into the Organization.  With the primary goal being restoration of these hearts using Kingdom Hearts.  Despite being an Old Man, Xehanort is one of, if not the most powerful man in the entire world line.  Excelling greatly in physical strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, and willpower. https://kh.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/1/19/Master_Xehanort_KHIII.png/1200px-Master_Xehanort_KHIII.png~ 
Xigbar; Xigbar, master assassin of the Organization and the right hand to Xehanort.  What's more menacing than a magic gun, dual wielding magic guns.  Despite his, or rather her loyalty to Master Xehanort, she is a loose cannon, often taking matters into her own hands.  Often times, she enjoys watching her prey squirm before finishing them off.  On top of her master marksmanship, she is also a master of short range and controlled teleportation so she can deal with foes up close or from afar.  While not one to disobey orders, she does seem to have her own motive.  Just what mysteries lie in Xigbar's past? https://i.imgur.com/OWNpLmF.jpg~ 
Saix; Saix is one of the strongest members of the Organization, and one of the most serious.  While Xigbar is the care free assassin, Saix can be equated to the unflinching guard.  Wielding a Double Axe larger than he is single handedly, his strength is not one to be questioned.  When out in the field, he gets things done without question and he tends to stay quiet.  He seems to have some connection to Axel, but his hardened exterior makes that hard to believe.  And you best not to make him angry, when Saix Berserks, his strength becomes so powerful, even his hair can't stand still.  Wielding up to 7 of his signature weapon at the same time. https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O5ejGylcGB0/maxresdefault.jpg~ 
Axel; Axel is one of the most outgoing members of the Org, often being the one to reach out to the newest members to welcome them in.   Though if you are against him, he'll be much colder despite his firey style and ensure when he defeats you, you'll memorize his name.  Of all the members of the Organization, Axel is the hardest to get a read on.  He may let on a friendly appearance, but who knows what's truly going on behind the mask. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/e/e5/Lea_KHIII.png/revision/latest?cb=20181216184634~ 
Demyx; Demyx is the laziest person in the Organization and is very much along for the ride.  Often times when he's on missions, he'll do the bare minimum or just not do them at all (no matter how many times his supervisors yell at him).  When you encounter him, he'll likely not wish to fight or put in the minimum effort to say "he tried," though mess with his Guitar, and they'll be trouble. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/c/c7/Demyx_KHD.png/revision/latest?cb=20140609033651~ 
Xion; Xion, just who is she?  Seriously, she exists as the first (and only) nobody who did not form from a person splitting.  Rather she is a vessel created by Zexion and Dess as an experiment to see if artificial beings can grow strong hearts if even such a small fragment was put in.   Tamashi, an organization character who you'll have to learn more about in the campaign, gave a small fragment of her heart in order to see the results of the experiment.  While Xion didn't have a personality or much purpose to existing aside from doing the Organization's bidding, hanging out with Roxas and Axel caused her heart to grow and eventually she became her own person.  What's most fascinating is that she, or they, have a nobody power which can allow them to appear different to certain individuals. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/8/89/Xion_%28Keyblade%29_KHIII.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/360?cb=20190329105141~ 
Vanitas; A common theme in Kingdom Hearts is Light vs Darkness.  Now Vanitas is a being of pure darkness only seeking the downfall of light and destruction of worlds.  What was originally a pawn for Xehanort has become a wild card, much more than Xigbar of this season.  If Vanitas wants something, she will get it by any means, regardless of the cost. Vanitas will likely go against her higher ups' orders to get what she wants.  And if you have something she wants, well, it won't be yours for long. https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/09d63701-93e6-4e40-974d-a6fe4a4ac424/d4zmy71-d4f26663-0a86-42e6-8831-95913c938138.jpg/v1/fill/w_768,h_1024,q_75,strp/kingdom_hearts_gender_bender_6_by_cathey18_d4zmy71-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTAyNCIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzA5ZDYzNzAxLTkzZTYtNGU0MC05NzRkLWE2ZmU0YTRhYzQyNFwvZDR6bXk3MS1kNGYyNjY2My0wYTg2LTQyZTYtODgzMS05NTkxM2M5MzgxMzguanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTc2OCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.xItbq4oide4m0x2T7w4CfaTm9b8z_5j3ttRrjJqH5Lc~ 
Roxas; In the original series Sora couldn't be complete when Roxas was alive, however said rules do not apply here.  Much like Sora, Roxas is quite brave fighting for those he cares about.  Though this time, it extends to more than his best friends of Xion and Axel.  Roxas is much more mature and thinks rationally compared to Sora, but he can be more aggressive when teased or messed with.  Roxas is one of the more adamant members of seeing the Org's plan through as he wants to live a normal life, one without the emptiness of being a nobody, and not having the burden of a keyblade. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/e/e7/Roxas_from_Days_render.png/revision/latest?cb=20200127033946~ 
Xemnas; One who knows nothing, can understand nothing.  Xemnas is the master and commander of nobodies, beings without hearts.  While in the original Kingdom Hearts, Xemnas is the nobody of Xehanort, that is not the case here.  Xemnas is one who thrives to gain a heart and works alongside Xehanort in order to use Kingdom Hearts (The moon) in order to give nobodies hearts once again.  He is cunning in his methodology, and although he may be cold, he enjoys the dreams other nobodies have and seeks to help them become whole once again.

Zexion; Zexion is very timid in his nature and often spends his time reading.  His nobody power is with illusions and often uses books as his tool for offence.  Though he didn't play a major role in S2, this season he... still doesn't play that big of a role.  But come on, not everyone can be the bigshots. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/b/bb/Zexion_KHD.png/revision/latest?cb=20190529230545~ 
Maleficent; Self Declared Mistress of all evil, Maleficent, despite being a whole being herself, has joined the Organization for unknown reasons.  She holds a strong force on the power of darkness, even being able to control lesser dark beings.  Maleficent is able to command and control the heartless and teams up with the nobodies to ensure her powers reign supreme.   Her desires used to be controlling worlds with her pet raven Diablo.  However upon meeting with Xehanort, something within her seems to have changed.  Those against her shall face her powers of darkness without remorse, but it seems she has a softer side.  What mysteries does this Queen of Evil hide?

Sephiroth; What has been a Super Boss these past 2 seasons, Sephiroth steps into the front lines as a main story character this time around. The Ultimate Super Soldier whose goals are to become one with the lifestream to become a God. This Soldier Works alone to achieve his goals, though if allying with anyone would help with his overall goal, he may be willing to assist. With his already immense power, Sephiroth is able to manipulate both Heartless and weak willed Nobodies. Will you be a useful ally for his goal, or be another pest standing in his way? https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/948a648d-63f5-4f66-b514-c7004f237882/dekdjnl-397e0746-aa41-4288-9cbc-fd44fb13b49a.jpg/v1/fill/w_1280,h_866,q_75,strp/ssbu___sephiroth_and_pichu_by_yyhyasha_dekdjnl-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9ODY2IiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvOTQ4YTY0OGQtNjNmNS00ZjY2LWI1MTQtYzcwMDRmMjM3ODgyXC9kZWtkam5sLTM5N2UwNzQ2LWFhNDEtNDI4OC05Y2JjLWZkNDRmYjEzYjQ5YS5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTI4MCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.ng1tkHiDhh0dZlQohJGJJHLf398BwPESqty8gw2AyL4~ 
Hanna; “Why, I'm Hanna, the most dangerous person in the campaign according to that silly little DM of yours, although I can't say she's wrong. As a kid, my dad was an abusive asshole, but then he died, oh well. My Mom? She celebrated his death a bit too hard and died as well! Ahaha, this world truly is super screwed up. My power? It's simply the ability to copy. As for what I like, it's also quite simple. I do whatever I want, and screw with whoever I want. It doesn't take much to get on my hit list, just look all sweet, peaceful, and happy with life. I just desire chaos and people to be as messed up in the head as me!” - Hanna https://64.media.tumblr.com/e74983587fa9efc1a682feaf41e2551e/tumblr_pymbkrQ3fg1r0xslpo1_500.png~ 
Cloud; After defecting from Shinra, he takes on work as a mercenary, only being interested in the task at hand.  Despite his cold exterior, he has a soft heart.  Wielding the Buster Sword fitting with quite a few materia to give him magical abilities, though he prefers fighting with his sword.  In this campaign he is a mercenary for hire holding no alliances and seeks to defeat his inner Darkness, Sephiroth.  You may be able to have him help you out for a cost, or your foes may do the same.   https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/5/5b/Cloud_Strife_from_FFVII_Remake_promo_render.png/revision/latest?cb=20190910180154~
